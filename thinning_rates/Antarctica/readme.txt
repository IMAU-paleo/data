Note: the supplementary data from Smith et al. (2020) consists of a bunch of .tif files that are  completely incomprehensible (separate files for grounded and floating thinning rates, which are defined on different grids). The 'dHdt_antarctica_4km.nc' was created and kindly shared by Tim van den Akker, who performed some sort of black magic to transform the Smith et al data into something useable.
